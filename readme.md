#CSV Date Format Changer

This script takes a csv file and changes the date format from dd/mm/yyyy to yyyy/mm/dd in the specified row. It then writes this to a new file that is named reformated - [orignialfile.csv] 

I honestly have no idea why you would use this outside of verry specific situations.

Usage:

    ./start [filename] [row number]

Example:

    ./start lel.csv 3

This works for the example file i added.
